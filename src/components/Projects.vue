    <h2>Chino Kafuu</h2>

    <p>
        A Discord bot I made that focus more on features than having funs. It is my first
        and only one project written in JavaScript. I used it to learn JavaScript and about
        how modern websites and networks work. Recently I learned some TypeScript,
        and is now slowly translating the bot to TypeScript. Besides, I am also linking my
        bot to cloud database for data storage. I always try my best to make the code up 
        to standard and easy to understand.

    <h2>AgefansCrawler</h2>

    <p>
        One of my Python project. It is able to collect information and download animes
        from Agefans website. The network at my home is always slow and laggy. Thus,
        I made this web crawler to download animes and watch them smoothly without 
        having to worry about network condition.
