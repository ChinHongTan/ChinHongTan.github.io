        <h1>Hi there!</h1>

        <p>
            My name is Chinono, or in Mandarine 智乃乃.
            I am a big fan of Chino Kafuu
            Currently 17 years old, and studying as a high school student in Malaysia.
            I can communicate in both Mandarine and English. Sure I can speak
            Malay, but English is prefered.
            As the covid 19 outbreak is especially serious in my country,
            I remain study at home around a year in total.
            Although I can’t leave my home due to the lockdown issued by the 
            government, I am able to develop my coding hobby with more time
            than before.
        </p>

        <p>
            Coding is one of my greatest hobby, and I enjoy doing it everyday.
            Currently, I can only code in JavaScript and Python, though I set my
            target to reach an intermediate level of JavaScript and Python, and
            aim for C++ next year.
            Besides coding, I also love solving math problems and watching
            youtube videos like science experiments and documentaries.
            And just like other teens of my age, I enjoys anime very much, just
            because they are cuteeeee &lt;3
            I am very fortunate to have a group of friends. We learn together,
            and support each other. I am really grateful to them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, I am a boy, please.
