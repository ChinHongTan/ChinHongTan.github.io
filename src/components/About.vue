    <p>My name is Chinono, or in Mandarine智乃乃
    I am a big fan of Chino Kafuu
    Currently 17 years old, and studying as a high school student in Malaysia.
    I can communicate in both Mandarine and English. Sure I can speak
    Malay, but English is prefered.
    As the covid 19 outbreak is especially serious in my country,
    I remain study at home around a year in total.
    Although I can’t leave my home due to the lockdown issued by the 
    government, I am able to develop my coding hobby with more time
    than before.</p>
    <p>Coding is one of my greatest hobby, and I enjoy doing it everyday.
    Currently, I can only code in JavaScript and Python, though I set my
    target to reach an intermediate level of JavaScript and Python, and
    aim for C++ next year.
    Besides coding, I also love solving math problems and watching
    youtube videos like science experiments and documentaries.
    And just like other teens of my age, I enjoys anime very much, just
    because they are cuteeeee &lt;3
    I am very fortunate to have a group of friends. We learn together,
    and support each other. I am really grateful to them.</p>
    <p>Also, I am a boy, please.</p>
